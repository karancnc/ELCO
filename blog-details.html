                    <p>Those seers might have been thinking about The George Tel Aviv, touted as Tel Aviv’s first
                        lifestyle destination.
                        Opened at the beginning of February and still accelerating to full operation, the establishment
                        (the management won’t call it a hotel), boasting 130 rooms plus 40 suites and junior apartments
                        designed for extended stays, in a spacious 14,000 sq. meters, has a lofty aim of satisfying what
                        the management calls SevenEx - seven urban experiences that focus on the needs of both locals
                        and temporary residents: Live, Work, Meet, Celebrate, Dine, Stay, and Relax.
                        The George is the first endeavor of Elco Hospitality, a subsidiary of Elco - one of Israel’s
                        leading public holding companies and owners of the Electra brand, as well as the ill-fated 7-11
                        chain. They brought in Michael Chai, with a wealth of experience in building and managing
                        boutique hotels in Israel and around the world, to run Elco Hospitality and manage the
                        establishment.“We’re a hotel, for sure, but we’re much more than that,” explained Elco
                        Hospitality’s VP of Brands, Partnerships, and Community, Eyal De Leeuw.</p>

                    <p>Embracing the growing global trend of members clubs within hotels, The George isn’t only open to
                        guests, but to local members, enabling them to partake of the SevenEx experience.For a monthly
                        fee (approximately NIS 850), members can use one of the many work zones The George provides,
                        complete with the fastest wi-fi, sparking kitchens, sleek workstations, and four spacious, fully
                        equipped conference rooms and events rooms. They also have full access to the relaxation zones
                        on The George’s wellness floor – a spa and treatment rooms, pilates lessons, dry and wet saunas,
                        a pool (opening soon), and a fully equipped gym with professional training sessions by Boost
                        studio. “To become a member, it’s not about what you do, you just need to have two
                        recommendations from existing members. That way, it’s very organic,” said De Leeuw. “It becomes
                        a community.”Entertainment and culinary-wise, there’s always something cooking at the hands of
                        celeb chef Barak Aharoni (formerly of the Norman) - between the soon-to-be-opened Pardes
                        restaurant (the only eatery of the establishment that will be open to the public at large), the
                        already up-and-running Loft which serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner to club members as well as
                        guests, a Deck Bar next to the pool, and a jazz hall featuring music most evenings. None of the
                        restaurants have kashrut certification and they are all open on Shabbat. However, a soon-to-open
                        farm products deli will possess a Zohar kashrut certificate.For greater Tel Aviv residents, it
                        sounds ideal. Located in the heart of the city, in the middle of a gentrifying area that was
                        full of, and still houses some chop shops and scrap metal yards, The George is a five-minute
                        walk from the bustle of Rothschild St. and a two-minute walk to the Carlebach light rail stop,
                        which puts the rest of the city at your fingertips.</p>

                    <h2>The kind of place you do not want to leave</h2>
                    <p>But for guests, like I recently was, it’s even better - a place you never want to leave. With
                        mesmerizing architecture and design by Lazaro Rosa Violan, The George features over 1,000 works
                        by Israeli artists, curated in collaboration with the Gordon Gallery. There’s nary an open space
                        or a wall that you won’t stop to gape at, sometimes in wonder.With members stopping by for a
                        drink or a cocktail or finishing their work day at the health club, there’s a feeling that
                        guests are inhaling the Tel Aviv cosmopolitan vibe through osmosis. It’s fun and contagious.
                        The rooms are meticulously designed with every inch used to create a cozy but elegant ambiance.
                        The corner room we stayed in wasn’t big but was certainly adequate. And the bathroom and shower
                        were something to write home about - elevated and cordoned off from the living area.We had
                        dinner and breakfast at Loft, a spacious, dimly lit venue that exudes Tel Aviv chic. I could
                        have sworn that the woman dining with a companion across the room was Bar Rafaeli, but my wife
                        told me to stop dreaming and look at the menu instead.Offering a combination of leafy, healthy
                        salads, pizzas, pastas, burgers, chicken, and steak, Loft’s menu covered most of the bases, and
                        the food was beautifully presented and tasty (and the entrees came out of the kitchen together,
                        not something to be taken for granted at Israeli restaurants.)Rather than the bountiful buffet
                        breakfast that is omnipresent in Israeli hotels, The George offers sit-down service with a menu
                        featuring a generous number of entrees. Each dish comes with a basket of freshly baked bread and
                        pastries and was more than ample. I was able to get up without feeling stuffed - as usually
                        happens after one of the buffets.
                        Last but certainly not least, there’s ample underground parking (for payment), which is
                        something you can never take for granted, especially in Tel Aviv.
                    </p>
                    <p>If I lived nearby, I’d surely befriend some members so they could vouch for my membership.
                        Luckily, though, with nightly rates comparable to most Tel Aviv hotels, I can still return as a
                        paying guest anytime.</p>
